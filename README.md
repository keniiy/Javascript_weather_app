# Javascript_weather_app
A simple web application built with javascripts getting weather information form <a href="https://accuweather.com/">Accuweather</a> using the 
<b>The Fetch API which allows you to asynchronously request for a resource. Use the fetch() method to return a promise that resolves into a Response object. To get the actual data, you call one of the methods of the Response object e.g., text() or json() . These methods also resolve into the actual data</b>

To use the app you can go to <a href="https://accuweather.com/">Accuweather website</a> create an account to get your api key which can be changed in the <a href="https://github.com/keniiy/Javascript_weather_app/blob/master/WEATHER_app_api/scripts/forecast.js ">Accuweather website</a>

The app was build using some javascripts methods like 
1)An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur. The simple example of an event is a user clicking the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard.
2)The innerHTML property is part of the Document Object Model (DOM) that allows Javascript code to manipulate a website being displayed. Specifically, it allows reading and replacing everything within a given DOM element (HTML tag).
3)A regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters. The JavaScript RegExp class represents regular expressions, and both String and RegExp define methods that use regular expressions to perform powerful pattern-matching and search-and-replace functions on text.
4)The setAttribute() method adds the specified attribute to an element, and gives it the specified value. If the specified attribute already exists, only the value is set/changed.
5)Search Results
Featured snippet from the web
The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. 2. The keyword "await" makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result. Why an async function would always return a promise if "await" pauses the execution waiting for a result?
